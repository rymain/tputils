# TPUtils
Simple utils for higher efficiency in Python and Linux.

## Scripts
Folder `scripts/` contains Linux scripts. To make them executable, 
update your path variable to include `scripts/` directory. 
Put this in `~/.profile` file to make it permanent.
```
export PATH=$PATH":$HOME/src/tputils/scripts"
```

and reload the file
```
$ . ~/.profile
```

Then you are able to access scripts from anywhere.
